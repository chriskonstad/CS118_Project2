# CS118 Project 2 - Group 15

## Build Instructions
Type `make` in the root directory.  This will recursively build the library, the client, and the server.

## Workload Distribution
To minimize code duplication, we built a shared library used by both the client and the server, `librdtp` (Reliable Data Transfer Protocol).  We worked on the protocol implementation together.  Chris designed the protocol while Ty designed the client and server architecture.
